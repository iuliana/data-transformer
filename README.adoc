== Data Transformer to convert Space data into piano symphonies

This project is to be used for NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2020

If the datafiles are too big use the `FileSplitter` utility to split them into smaller manageable files.

The `MainRunner` reads all files under `src/main/resources/processed`, AND transforms them into a suite of piano keys.
